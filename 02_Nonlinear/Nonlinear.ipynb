    "Once completed the tutorial in linear elasticity, we can move on to non-linear problems. SU2 has been designed using a finite-deformation framework$^1$ to account for geometrical and material non-linearities. In this tutorial, we use the same problem definition as for the linear elastic case. First, we will cover the definition of geometrical and material non-linearities.
